## **Technical Details**
**Technologies Used**

- MySQL, Node.js, Express
- Handlebars to generate all HTML
- ORM to create a log of burgers devoured or not yet devoured

**Explanation**

Using a home-grown ORM, the app has three basic CRUD functions.

1. READ all entries from the MySQL database and display them to the DOM using Handlebars.
2. CREATE a new entry to the MySQL database by clicking "Add Veggie Burger".
3. UPDATE a selected veggie burger by clicking "Devour It!"
4. DELETE a selected veggie burger by clicking "Gone!"
